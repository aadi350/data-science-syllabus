# Things to Consider When Choosing an ML Algorithm   

number of training examples, (how large is your training set?)  
if small: high bias/low variance classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes), less likely to overfit  
if large: low bias/high variance classifiers (e.g., kNN or logistic regression)  
dimensionality of the feature space  
is the problem linearly separable?  
are features independent?  
are features expected to linearly dependent with the target variable?  
is overfitting expected to be a problem?  
system requirement: speed, performance, memory usage  
Does it require variables to be normally distributed?  
Does it suffer multicollinearity issue?  
Dose it do as well with categorical variables as continuous variables?  
Does it calculate CI without CV?  
Does it conduct variables selection without stepwise?  
Does it apply to sparse data?
