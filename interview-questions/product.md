# Business  
**There is a pool of people who took Uber rides from two cities that were close in proximity, for example, Menlo Park and Palo Alto, and any data you could think of could be collected. What data would you collect so that the city the passenger took a ride from could be determined?”**  
To determine the city, we need to have access to the location/geographical data. The data collected could be GPS coordinates, longitude/latitude, and ZIP code


**What is the most important aspect of analytical reporting?**  
> *Analytical reporting is a type of business reporting that offers information, data analysis and recommendations. The recommendations are what set this type of reporting apart from informational reporting. Analytical reporting allows people to use data to make decisions.*   

While data itself cannot solve problems, it can equip you to make the right business decisions when analyzed in context. Even if a certain decision does not produce the results you expected, data allows you to learn from those results to continue improving. The most important aspect of analytical reporting is the ability to solve problems and make decisions based on facts. Attempting to make decisions based on uninformed guesses or assumptions can be problematic—analytical reporting provides tangible information with which to create strategy and direction

**Describe how you typically approach a project?**  
> General phases through which I get work done with standard deliverables 

I first listen to what a client needs, paying attention to what they articulate as their goals for the project. I then take a deeper look into our data to figure out how to guide them toward success or how to change the way they are looking at their goals to move forward in a more productive way. Of course, every project and every client requires something new, so I always make sure to consider the specific situation instead of automatically imposing a one-size-fits-all solution
