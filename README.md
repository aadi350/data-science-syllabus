# Data Science Syllabus
This is a collection of topics, resources and otherwise useful resources I found (am finding) during pursuit of my graduate degree in Data Science. This list may not be completely exhaustive, and I am going to miss some niche things, however this is what I'd consider a ground zero for covering important topics in data science.
