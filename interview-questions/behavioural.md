# STAR-I Technique
Structured way to respond to behavioural intervie questions

**Situation**  
Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.  

**Task** 
What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?  

**Action** 
Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.

**Result** 
Describe the outcome. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

**Improvement**  
Given your series of tasks and the result, what did you learn, and what would you do differently in the future?
